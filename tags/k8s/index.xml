      <description>Background There are bunch of services lying around on my homelab. Over time, the accumulated complexity, ops load, reliability risk, and security risks started to harm my mental health. I figured it&amp;rsquo;s probably the time to properly tidy up my homelab and have it actually managed. I figured my ideal setup shall be secure, reasonably reliable, at a low ops cost. More specifically, I would like to:&#xA;Have some services running Have some declarative way to manage them Have some isolation on what each services could access Have automated updates Very simple and innocent requirements, right?</description>
